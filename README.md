```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/silverneko/miku.git
```

#### How to start the judge client
```bash
$ make
$ sudo ./start_script
```
some configuration can be made inside startscript like:
-v(, or --verbose) for extra verbosity
-p(, or --parallel) [NUMBER] to have maxium [NUMBER] of parallel processes to evaluate usercode. However this may cause verbosity messages unreadable.
-b [NUMBER] to set sandbox indexing offset. Need to be set to an appropriate number if running multiple judges on one computer.
-a(, or --aggressive-update) add this to aggressivly update verdict and result.

### Known issues
sandbox doesn't set output limit: https://github.com/cms-dev/cms/issues/309
